# Notebooks in Computational Metabolomics

This repo is a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering topics in metabolomics data analysis and computational methods. 

Some of the notebooks were written as part of publications. Users should distinguish questions on metabolomics and on general computing techniques. The latter often have ready answers on the internet. The notebooks are not limited to Python, but the majority here are in Python.

Feel free to explore the notebooks under `notebooks/`.
The HTML/ folder is no longer updated, as GitHub renders `.ipynb` now.

Notebooks may be written quickly during data analysis, not as clean as desired pedagogical materials. Users should use discretion on dated materials or erros. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Use Jupyter notebooks via VS Code
This is the preferred way of doing data analysis in our research lab. VS Code is a development environment:
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Then install Python and Jupyter notebook within VS Code.

## Use R or Python Jupyter notebooks via Docker containers
See [Docker page](/docker.md)

## Example notebooks

- [Averaging technical replicates](notebooks/Averaging_technical_replicates.ipynb)
- [Statistical analyses of metabolite features (group comparison)](notebooks/Statistics_group_comparison.ipynb)
- [Clustering of metabolite peaks from LC-MS](notebooks/HCL_clustering_considering_retention_time.ipynb)
- [Bubble plot, using scatter plot panels to visualize result from pathway analysis](notebooks/Bubble_plot_pathways.ipynb)
- [Illustration of mass tracks in asari](notebooks/asari2023_Notebook_Composite_mass_tracks.ipynb)
- [Illustration of khipu plots for isotope tracing data](notebooks/khipu2023_demo_khipu_plot.ipynb)
- [Analyzing the cardiomyocyte data in asari pipeline](notebooks/pcpfm_Bowen2023_analysis.ipynb)
- More under `notebooks/`.
